General Algorithms
=====================

PyG-SSL includes state-of-the-art algorithms for Self-Supervised Learning on arbitrary/general graphs. Many of the SSL algorithms are contrastive-learning-based, and PyG-SSL 
also include two non-contrastive learning algorithms, BGRL and AFGRL. In this page, we provide the detailed information of how to use each algorithm by PyG-SSL.
