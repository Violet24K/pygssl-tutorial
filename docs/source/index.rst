GraphSSL documentation
===================================

**GraphSSL** is a Python library built upon `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org>`_.
It integrates state-of-the-art algorithms for Self-Supervised Learning on Graphs and offers simple APIs to 
call the algorithms from a variety of high-quality research papers. GraphSSL can be helpful for many downstream tasks, depending on the dataset
properties, as it contains many self-supervised algorithms for different kinds of graphs:

   **General/Regular Graphs**

   **Heterogeneous/Multiplex/Multiview Graphs**

   **Molecular Graphs**
